                <b> Discovery Phase </b>
                Worked with client to identify their core learning objectives which in this case was breaking through decision paralysis in the face of making small or big change.
                <br>My design focused on systematizing the core game loop of an issue and addressing it to allow the client full flexibility and agency with creating effective content that best suited their learning goals
                <br><b>Beta Testing</b>
                In early interviews with kids we found some issues resonated more than others. For the targeted age group it was important to balance issues that would feel impactful but not be too abstract to understand.
                <br>Codesigning with our kid testers helped us really hone in on details in the course of action that made sense for a kid imagining themselves in this situation. We went through many iterations of content to really nail a kid's feeling that the game was realistic and they could take these lessons into their real life too.
                <br><b>Release</b>
                Designed features around real-time polling data, UI Accessibility Plugin (UAP) to enable screen reading features and dynamic color settings. <br /><br />
